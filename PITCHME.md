Definition
> The goal is to define a datatype by cases, where one can add new cases to the
> datatype and new functions over the datatype, without recompiling
> existing code, and while retaining static type safety (e.g., no
> casts).

### Example Problem

|           | Logistic Regressor | DecisionTree Regressor|   |   |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|---|---|
| fit()      |                    |                       |   |   |
| predict() |                    |                       |   |   |
|           |                    |                       |   |   |

### Solution Criteria

1. Recompilation (Repacking of Existing Code)
2. Static Typesafety
3. Minimal Duplication and Modification

### Extensibility in Two Directions

### Other Language Solutions

- Visitor Pattern - OOP
- Open Classes/Monkey Patching - Ruby
- Multimethods - Clojure

---

### Visitor Pattern

- Example
- Problems (Verbosity, Accidental Complexity)

---

### Open Classes/Monkey Patching - Ruby

- Example
- Problems (TERRIFYINGLY AWESOME)

---

### Basic Scala Machinery

- Implicit Resolution
- Context Bounds

---

### What is a typeclass?

- the trait, the concrete instances and the implicits are the pattern
- Pattern vs Language Feature
